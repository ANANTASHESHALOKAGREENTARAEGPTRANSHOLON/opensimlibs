== TESTING PLAN ==
My plan for running the unit tests on SubversionSharp is as follows:
    * re-extract the working copy and repo from the tarball on each run of the
      tests.
    * run any possible tests which read from the WC only (wc info, status, ...)
    * test the "switch" command by performing a switch (with --relocate) on the
      wc
    * run any possible tests which read from the Repo (log, url info, ls ...)
    * run tests which perform changes to the WC only (update, svn add, ...) and
      use "info" and "status" to verify these
    * run tests which perform changes to WC and Repo (commit, svn mkdir on
      url, ...) and use "ls", "cat" etc. to verify these
